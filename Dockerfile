# Base image must satisfy pyproject.toml's `requires-python = ">=3.14"`.
# With a 3.12 base, uv silently downloads its own managed 3.14 at build time —
# the image works, but the FROM tag is a lie and the image carries two Pythons.

# Keeps uv out of the app's dependency tree entirely.

# Dependencies before app source, so this layer is cached and only re-runs when
# pyproject.toml or uv.lock actually change.
COPY pyproject.toml uv.lock ./

# --frozen: fail if uv.lock is out of date rather than silently re-resolving.
# --no-install-project: install dependencies only; this project has no
#   [build-system], so it runs from source and `app/` is simply copied in.
